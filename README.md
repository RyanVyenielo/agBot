What is up guys?!

This is our Cal Poly BRAE Github Repository for the agBot project. 

Here, we can work on our source code and transfer versions in a more
efficient manner. 

This will give us a good chance to work with Git as a collaboration 
tool and help us build industry ready skills that are usefull to 
employers. 

If you have any questions about how github works, use this link:

It should give you a firm understanding of the usefull commands
you will need to master to use Github efficently.
